# Skin_decease-classification
Using deep learning to classify skin decease types using HAM1000 dataset
This popular dataset was an important asset in the field of medical science to pave the way for detecting skin disease in the earlier stages. The aim of this project was to create a prediction model to identify skin disease. 
Here total images used for training - 1400 
The accuracy was ~64%
The image size applied is 64x64 instead of 32x32
Activation Function Used: Softmax
Optimizer: Adam
Further Improvements might be added in the future.
